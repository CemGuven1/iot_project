## Data Visualization for IOT device

This project is an IoT data monitoring platform designed to visualize real-time sensor data collected from building-mounted IoT devices. Each device transmits information such as acceleration, temperature, rotation, and vibration to a Python-based TCP server. 
The data is then processed and displayed through a Django web application, providing users with clear and interactive charts for analysis. The entire system is containerized using Docker, ensuring easy deployment, scalability, and reliable performance across 
different environments.
